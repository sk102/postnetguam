## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Manual Tracking:** Renewal dates, payment status, and recipient changes are tracked manually, leading to errors and missed deadlines
2. **Compliance Risk:** ID expirations and USPS form requirements are difficult to monitor across 2,000+ mailboxes
3. **Customer Communication:** No automated system for reminding customers about renewals or required documentation
4. **Operational Inefficiency:** Staff spend excessive time looking up account information and generating notices
5. **Accountability:** No audit trail for changes made to customer accounts

### Impact

- Lost revenue from missed renewal follow-ups
- Compliance violations from expired documentation
- Poor customer experience due to reactive rather than proactive communication
- Staff frustration and inefficiency
